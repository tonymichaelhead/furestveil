**WELCOME TO FÜRESTVEIL UNIVERSITY** - A 1000-year-old university set in an ancient castle deep in the heart of Fürestveil Woods. Set to the tone of dark fantasy, with notes of dark academia and gothic horror.

This is a perilous setting for pen-and-paper adventure games. It is written for basic and expert-type games with broader OSR compatibility in mind.

## The Setting
A megadungeon/hexcrawl hybrid that revolves around Fürestveil University, the multi-leveled dungeon beneath, and the wilderness surrounding the school. This mini-setting fits within a 6-mile hex and can be dropped into any larger sandbox campaign.

### Features
- The University Castle - serves as the "town" or safe haven for the players to recuperate, buy gear, collect rumors, and even attend class.
- Mini-megadungeon - 7 levels, average 30 rooms per level.
- 19-tile hexcrawl.
- Optional class/exam mechanics that allow characters to earn bonus XP.
- Advice for running an open table/West Marches style campaign in Fürestveil.
- A drug-slinging golden dragon.

## The Project
 A labor of love and an effort to share the world of Fürestveil University with the OSR community. It is in the "ashcan" or beta phase of its development. As I continue to playtest, polish, and refine, I will upload the setting piece by piece as it becomes available. Feedback is welcome and encouraged, as I strive to make the world of Fürestveil more accessible to game masters and their players.
