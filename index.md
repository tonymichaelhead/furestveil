**WELCOME TO FÜRESTVEIL UNIVERSITY** - A university for adventurers nestled deep in the heart of the Fürestveil Woods. A place for fighters, thieves, and spellcasters alike to adventure, study, and solve the mysteries of a 1000-year-old castle!

This is a dark and brutal setting for pen-and-paper adventure games. It is written for basic and expert type games with broader OSR compatibility in mind.
