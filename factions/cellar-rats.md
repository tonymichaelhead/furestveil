## The Cellar Rats
Miscreant students at Fürestveil University who fancy themselves a "gang" and commit petty crime. They have claimed the shoddy [Wine Cellar]({% link the-under-school/level-1.md %}#6-wine-cellar) in the Under-School as their place of business. They bully, steal, and occasionally harm other students in their quest for notoriety and riches. <!-- They dislike the Lawful Adventuring Party. -->

They seek to exterminate the pixies in the [Pixie Lair]({% link the-under-school/level-1.md %}#22-a-pixie-lair---room-1), steal their treasure, and secure the entire first level of the Under-School for their own, but require extra fighting power to do so.
