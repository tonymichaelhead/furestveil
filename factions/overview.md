## Faction Overview

### The Moonlight Fellowship
A gang-like clan of wererats living in the walls of the school. They seek to spread the "gift" of lycanthropy to all those willing to receive it. They believe people must voluntarily choose lycanthropy or it will forever be regarded as taboo, and therefore do not turn people against their will.

### The Cellar Rats
Miscreant students at FÃ¼restveil University who fancy themselves a "gang" and commit petty crime. They have claimed the shoddy [Wine Cellar]({% link the-under-school/level-1.md %}#6-wine-cellar) in the Under-School as their place of business. They bully, steal, and occasionally harm other students in their quest for notoriety and riches. See [The Cellar Rats]({% link factions/cellar-rats.md %}) for more info.
