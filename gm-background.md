## Overview

### Fürestveil University
A 1000-year-old institution located in a castle built over a mountain basin. It is a prestigious 4-year university that teaches the core knowledge needed to brave the perils of an adventuring lifestyle, such as self-defense, wilderness survival, magic fundamentals, and dungeoneering. Adventurers of all classes will sprout wings here. 

Led by Headmaster Sterling, the total population of the Fürestveil Castle is roughly 1500, with around 1000 of that being students, 100 school guards, and the rest being instructors and staff.
### The Under-School
The former castle that housed the university was built at the bottom of the mountain basin and used its walls as protection against outside threats. However, this earlier castle fell 300 years ago in the Great War of Fürestveil. The ruins of the decimated school remained at the bottom of the mountain basin while the new castle was built on top. Many of the ruins of the former school still stand, and form a seemingly bottomless complex of ruins and caves under the university known as the "Under-School". The Under-School, full of secrets and wealth lost to time, is a place for both budding adventurers to cut their teeth on and seasoned explorers to secure their retirement. Not even the school staff, nor historians of Fürestveil, know how deep the Under-School actually goes or what chaos lurks below.
### Fürestveil Region
The mountains and woods that surround the university make up the region of Fürestveil and are roughly 6 miles in diameter (fitting in one six-mile hex). The surrounding wilderness is vibrant with wildlife, both critters, and intelligent inhabitants.

A subsection of the Fürestveil Woods has been cursed with dark magic and rotted into a dark fungal swamp teeming with undead, while a magical black haze hangs in the sky, and causes perpetual nightfall. Students are advised not to leave the castle unless under the supervision of experienced staff. Nevertheless, the school is unable to keep every brave novice adventurer (and sometimes staff!) from exploring the woods and attempting to claim a piece of whatever fortune lies out there.
