## Background

Beneath Fürestveil University are the ruins of the former school castle that fell 300 years ago in the Great War. The current school has been built on top of the ruins, but remnants of the former school, known as the "Under-School", lie below, partially intact. Brave students and adventurers alike visit the Under-School to uncover the mysteries of this 1000-year-old institution, and to fill their pockets with relics and treasure as a rite of passage. Occasionally, they return with pockets full of gold and stories to tell.

### The Vibe
*Pointed archways, vaulted ceilings, crumbled limestone walls overgrown with moss, water dripping from walls and ceiling, toppled pillars, and collapsed stonework.*

### The Adventure
A horrific demon stalks the halls of Fürestveil University at night, liquefying students with a single gaze and devouring their insides. Headmaster Sterling has offered the party 5000gp to expunge the demon from the school. Rumor has it that the demon is tethered to a cursed piece of alchemy equipment, an *alembic*, which lies somewhere in the Under-School.

### Treasure Table

‣ **The Cellar Rats**: (see [The Cellar Rats]({% link factions/cellar-rats.md %})) have turned the old wine cellar into their hideout. Present on first visit. 25% chance they will be present on subsequent visits, and 25% chance per turn they will arrive if not present. 
- **Wants** to kill the pixies and steal their treasure. Also wants recruits to join their gang of petty crime.
- **Knows:** about [Samson](#samson).

‣ **Searching the wine casks:** most are empty. One has a removable face plate and contains stolen treasure inside: a silver choker with a woman's face engraved on it (75gp), a diamond-encrusted golden belt buckle (230gp), a false eye made from clear quartz(150gp), 500gp, 450sp, and 150cp.

‣ **Investigating the curtain:** hides a crumbled stone stairway leading up to the Hungry Scholar.

### 7. Hanging Moss
*Sounds of crunching and chittering to the east.*
- **Dark green moss** (thick, wispy, hanging like a blanket from the ceiling in the hallway). 
- **Small window** (1'x1', iron bars)

‣ **The moss:** if disturbed, releases spores in a 5' radius. 1d4 poison damage or save against poison for half damage. It is possible to pass underneath without disturbing if the players are careful.

‣ **Looking through the window:** see the [Samson](#samson) in **Area 8** feasting on a corpse, crunching and chittering.

---

### 8. Samson
*Crunching, chittering, and growling. The smell of burnt flesh.* *Scorch marks cover the room.*
- **4 pillars** (ornate relief carvings of wizards casting magic at foes, covered in soot).
- ***Samson*** (munching on a corpse).
- ***North:*** **stone door** (relief carving of an open book with the dwarven word for "power" on the page).
- ***South:*** **stone door** (completely charred black).

‣ **Searching the corpses:** find 2 silver daggers, a tiny golden halfling sword lined with emeralds (500gp), a pouch of moonstone (enough to power school wards for 1 month, worth 600gp total), 2 *Purple Honey Potions* (heal 1d4), a *Sleep Potion*, 250gp, and 75sp.

{: .statblock }
> #### Samson
> A grotesque, 6-foot-tall cockroach body with the head of a cat. Breathes fire. It was once a normal cat, but a half-succeeded resurrection attempt by Professor Chives mutated it into an abomination (see [Professor Chives and Samson](#professor-chives-and-samson)).
> 
> **Hit Dice:** 3* **Armor:** 5 [14] **To-hit:** 17 [+2] <br>
> **Attack:** 2 × claw (1d3),  1 × bite (1d6) or 1 × breath (2d4) <br>
> **Move:** 120’ (40’) <br>
> **Saves:** D12 W13 P14 B15 S16 <br>
> **Morale:** 9 **Alignment:** Chaotic **XP:** 50 <br>
> 
> - **Attack pattern:** 50% chance of breath attack instead of bite.
> - **Fire breath:** projects fire in the shape of a cone (30' long and 10' wide at the end). Save against breath for half damage.

---

### 9. Bathhouse
*Dimly lit from large holes in the ceiling. Tranquil sounds of trickling water. Fresh, pure air.*
- **Large stone bathtub** (circular, 25' in diameter, water slowly overflowing).
- **Cherub heads** (mounted on walls, spout fresh, pristine water into the overflowing bathtub).
- ***South:*** **wooden door** (faded mural of cherubs dancing above a lake).
- ***West:*** **wooden door** (plain, unmarked).
- ***East:*** **wooden door** (faded mural of a battle scene).

‣ **Drinking the water:** +1 on all ability rolls for the rest of the day. Limit once a day per character.

‣ **Resting in this room:** Safe zone (no random encounters). There are ancient wards that keep monsters away. Do not reveal this to players! Clever players who figure this out may camp here.

---

### 10. Candle Room
*Serene. Dimly lit by candlelight.*
- **Hundreds of floating candles** (red, partially melted, floating at chest height, gently bounce around weightlessly).
- ***North:*** **stone double doors** (relief carving of two crossed swords).
- ***East:*** **wooden door** (stuck, musical notes painted on it).
- ***West:*** **wooden door** (faded painting of relaxing forest scenery).

‣ **Inspecting the candles:** brass holders with "Fürestveil University" engraved on them in elven script. Candles are enchanted with magic that preserves their current state, so they will never melt any further. 

‣ **Removing candles from the room:** the enchantment disappears from the removed candle.

---

### 11. Drawing Room
*Smell of moldy cotton and wood furniture.*
- **Lounge chairs** (appear once very comfortable and luxurious, now rotten and dilapidated).
- **Plain green rug** (in front of one of the chairs).
- **Painting** (west wall, 10' long, 7' tall, silver frame).

‣ **The painting:** depicts the inside of the school Observatory long ago. In the scene, people stand inside the Observatory. There are glowing runes on the wall, and the ceiling appears to be an open night sky with stars and planets. The painting is magically animated.

‣ **Value of the painting:** The painting is quite valuable as a historical piece: worth 5000gp, but it is very bulky and heavy, and too large to fit through most dungeon doors. Exiting the dungeon with the painting will pose a significant challenge to a low-level party. Attempting to dismantle it in any way removes the animation enchantment and drops the value to 1000gp.

---

### 12. Music Room
 *Rays of light peak in through small openings in the ceiling. Rhythmic sound of dripping water.* 
- **Instruments scatter the room** (broken, decomposing, worthless).
- **Stone table** (elegantly crafted, covered in runes).
- **Music stand** (still contains a mostly preserved piece of music scribbled on parchment).
- **Stone closet** (6' tall and 4' wide, magically sealed, engraved in elven "Music is spirit embodied").

#### The Stone Table
This narrow stone table is actually a magical keyboard. There are 24 runes (keys) about the size of a human hand. When the runes are touched, they glow a variety of colors, and a deep, rich tone is played.

‣ **Playing the sheet music:** INT check to read and DEX check to play (taking one turn total). If read and played correctly, the seal on the stone closet is broken, and the door opens. Failed attempts may be repeated at the expense of time.

#### Stone Closet
‣ **Contains:** a *Pixie Whistle*, a small antique silver harp (250gp), dwarven wooden drum (200gp), drumsticks with hides stretched over the tips (75gp for the pair).

‣ ***Pixie Whistle***: a small, wooden, enchanted whistle. When blowing the Pixie Whistle, pixies within a 120' radius become instantly charmed (no save). The effects are similar to *Charm Person*, except the enchantment wears off after 1 week (but can be reapplied with another whistle blow). The owner of this whistle becomes a target, as fae creatures will be drawn to its magic and will seek to take it for their own gain.

---

### 13. The Banquet
*Pitch black. Laughter, chatter, and the sound of silverware clinking against dishes.*

- ***Ghost Scholars* sitting around a table** (2 elves, 2 dwarves, and 2 humans, feasting on translucent food and wine, laughing and having a good time).
- **Banquet table** (fine, well-preserved dinnerware)
- ***North:*** sound of reverberating childlike voices and laughter.
- ***West:*** sound of gentle waltz music.
- ***East:*** gentle beams of light peaking in from holes in the ceiling illuminate the corridor with dim light.

#### Ghost Scholars
Unaware of the party's presence, and will ignore any attempts made by the party to communicate. If the party attempts to touch them, they will not react. However, any attempt to harm the ghosts (i.e., silver or magic) or touching any of the dinnerware will cause the ghosts to become aware of their presence and become hostile.

‣ **Stats:** As [Ghost Guards](#ghost-guards) without swords. Ghost Scholars will throw dishes and silverware (1d4 damage, roll to hit).

‣ **Dinnerware value:** elven white-silver silverware: 10 sets (70gp per set), dwarven dinnerware elegantly carved from stone with gold ores swirled inside: 10 small plates (30gp each), 10 teacups (40gp), one small teapot (100gp).

- **Wooden shelves** (damp, rotten)
- **Ancient tomes** (mostly molded and disintegrated).
- **Crumbled stone statue** (scholarly dwarf, "Master Dulgruk" engraved on plaque).
- **Corpse** (crushed by falling stone, robed).
- ***West:*** **wooden door** (stuck, picture of a dark green and silver shield painted on it).
- ***North:*** smell of spring flowers and fresh rain.
- ***South:*** sounds of chatter and clinking silverware.

‣ **Searching the tomes:** find a book of loose notes with a leather cover bound together with string. Cast as an M-U scroll: Invisibility of 10' Radius, Light (Darkness), Dispel Magic, Growth of Plants, and a scroll containing Snake Charm, and Remove Curse (Curse).

‣ **The corpse:** is a cultist. Wears a fake golden skull ring with painted-in blood under the eyes (worthless). Carries a notebook.

‣ **The Cultist's Notebook:** dark arcane symbols and detailed notes on unsealing The Founder (lich) from his tomb. Reads like an M-U scroll. Cast on the Founder's tomb in the cemetery to break the magical seal and release him.

---

### 15. The Classroom
*The scent of sweet, spring flowers and fresh rain.*
- **Dense graffiti** (Sylvan, covers walls and floor, glowing pink and green).
- **Black chalkboard** (equations, symbols, notes from a Magic Fundamentals class long ago).
- **Wooden chairs** (swollen with rot and damp).

‣ **Reading the Sylvan**: those literate in Sylvan will find that most of the graffiti is childlike jokes and obscenities ("FÜRESTVEIL STINKS!", etc.). A thorough investigation of the text reveals that no monsters can enter the bathhouse in **Area 9** "Bathhouse".

---

### 16. Tutoring Room (Alternate Entrance)
*Dusty, dark.* 
- **Wooden table** (plain).
- **Brass goblet** (sitting upon the table, empty).
- **Stone door** (appears ancient, ornate elven runes "Fürestveil University", no handles, sealed with magic).
- **Chalkboard** (black, dusty, nothing written on it).

‣ **If the stone door or goblet is touched:** the words "DRINK ME" slowly appear on the chalkboard as if written in chalk, and the goblet magically fills with wine.

‣ **If the wine is drunk:** the seal temporarily disappears and the door pops open. Roll on the *Wine Effects* table. Any subsequent drinks will not affect the same drinker until the dungeon is exited and the effects wear off.

‣ **If the goblet is removed:** A new one will appear in its place a day later. The brass goblet itself is worthless.


| 1d6 | Wine Effects                              |
| --- | ----------------------------------------- |
| 1   | No effect.                                |

| 6   | +2 temporary HP                           |

- ***West:*** **stairs leading down** (smell of musty, moldy parchment).
- ***East:*** **stone door** (plain and unmarked, leads to **Area 16** "Tutoring Room").

‣ **The tapestry:** conceals a hidden, unlocked wooden door. Depicts a scholarly dwarf reading from a book, an elf clad in leather armor with a sword, and a robed human with a magical orb floating above his hands (the school founders). They are instructing a group of children in the forest.

---

### 18. Training Room
*Shafts of light in sparse beams. Smell of rust.*
- 5 ***Skeleton Guards*** (lie on floor, wearing rotted green gambesons, animate and attack if anyone sets foot in the room).
- **9 wooden training dummies** (with scorch marks from magical blasts, a few of them dressed in armor).

- ***East:*** **wooden door** (stuck, image of an open tome painted on it).
- ***West:*** **wooden door** (painting of two cherubs flying above a pond, faint sounds of trickling water beyond the door).
- ***South:*** **stone double doors** (relief carving of an elven maiden in pajamas holding up a candle to light the way).

‣ **Investigating the training dummies:** find leather armor (scorched but usable), *Elven Chainmail* (+2 against corporeal undead, +1 against all other creatures).

‣ **The training rack contains**: 2 spears, a rusty, blunt sword (does 1d4 damage), battered plate armor (unsightly, but still works fine), and 3 +2 arrows.

‣ **Disturbing the treasure:** If the treasure is touched while the statue's head is uncovered, a poisonous gas is released from a tiny hole in the mouth. Everyone within a 5' radius of the statue must save against poison or die. The gas will not be released while the eyes are covered.

‣ **The bronze bowl contains:** a thin silver necklace (5gp), 4 rubies (50gp), 5 emeralds (10gp), 150gp, 50sp, and a *Clairaudience Potion* (hear through another creature's ears for 1d6+6 turns. Range: 60'. Blocked by lead).

If Gus wins, he will possess one body immediately. If he loses, he will willingly hand over the sword. Stats as [Ghost Guards](#ghost-guards). More than one character may play, increasing the odds of Gus losing. However, all participants must wager their bodies. If Gus wins against multiple participants, he will summon his other guard friends to inhabit the remaining bodies.

‣ **The Game Rules:** the first to score 100 points wins. Multiple players may join.
- Each turn, a player rolls a die as many times as they like until they decide to "hold" or roll a "1".
- If the player rolls any number besides a 1, that number is added to their running total points for the turn.
- If a player decides to "hold", the points accumulated on their turn are added to their total score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If a 1 is rolled, they score no points for their turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.

‣ **If Gus inhabits a body:** he will spend his days at the Hungry Scholar hustling money from students, while attempting to keep his true nature a secret.

‣ **The drums:** very poor condition. Moldy and swollen with damp. Worth nothing to most intelligent creatures, but the pixies love them.

‣ **Playing the drums:** excites the pixies. They will dance and fly around with glee, magically warping the sound waves to make the drumbeats melodic. The drumbeat vibrations become a multitude of colorful waves in the air.

---

*Damp and musty. Cramped and cluttered. Covered in dust.*
- **Wooden shelves** (moldy and rotten).

‣ **The Glass Alembic:** is in fact, the *Cursed Alembic*. See below.
<!-- See [[Demon#The Cause of the Curse|The Cause of the Curse]]. Breaking the alembic or removing the curse instantly releases the [[Demon#Demon|Demon]] (with weakened stats). -->

‣ **Search the clutter:** find diagrams of cockroach DNA, and various sketches of cockroach and cat anatomy. Search the clutter for 10 minutes and find: a *Bravery Potion* (immune to fear effects for 2d4 turns), a *Polymorph Potion* (works like M-U's Polymorph Self), 2 *Lv. 9 Cure Disease Potions* (equivalent to casting Cure Disease at lv. 9).

#### Professor Chives and Samson
Professor Chives had a beloved pet cat named Samson, who recently died of natural causes. Deeply saddened by Samson's death, Professor Chives desperately attempted to revive him by patching his failed organs with cockroach stem cells, thus creating a terrible abomination (see [Samson](#8-samson)). Professor Chives now works tirelessly on a cure for Samson and sneaks into the former alchemy lab in the Under-School to work in privacy and to take care of Samson, whom he has hidden there (**Area 8**). Little does he know, the old alchemy equipment is cursed, and his use of the equipment unknowingly released a terrible demon that stalks the school corridors at night<!-- ([[Demon#The Cause of the Curse|The Cause of the Curse]]) -->.

‣ **On first visit:** Professor Chives will be present. 50% chance he will be present on subsequent visits, and 25% chance per turn he will arrive if not present. 

‣ **Reaction to the party:** Professor Chives will be bothered that the party is interrupting his work and ask them politely to finish up their business and leave. 

‣ **If the party killed Samson:** Professor Chives will lament the death of his pet, but will be grateful that the party has done what he could not and put Samson out of his misery.
